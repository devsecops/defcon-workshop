* This repository has all the code that will be presented/used in our Defcon Workshop - [Harnessing the Power of Docker and Kubernetes to Supercharge Your Hacking Tactics](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/harnessing-the-power-of-docker-and-kubernetes-to-supercharge-your-hacking-tactics-octavius-7-tickets-35851060487).

* The entire workshop is divided into 4 Sections. We will walk through the basics including the setting up of all the software and tools necessary to understand the concepts.

* Finally, we will finish off the workshop with some advanced use cases and demonstrate how they can be used to automate and scale security testing using Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform.
